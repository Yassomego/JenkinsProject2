	// We identify our test Scenarios 
	// Each Scenario pertains to one functionality what we are testing 
	// We write Test cases in Different Classes - positive and negative
	// Run all the test cases together with testng.xml file
	// Generally there is a lot of code which is quiet common to all test cases
	// we move the common code which is used again and again to one particular class
	// This class acts as the parent class
	// Other Classes act as the child class
